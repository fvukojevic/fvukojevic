# Hello! 👋

### I am Ferdo Vukojević

- 🔭 I'm a Masters degree Software Engineer 👨‍💻🎧. Mostly doing Backend/DevOps/Database work, but with experience with Frontend as well, mostly Vue & React. On the Backend I like to consider myself to be language agnostic since I had pleasure of working with multiple languages (Python, Go, PHP, Java, Kotlin, Scala, JS...)

- 🌱 I'm in a learning mindset where I prefer to learn new things, design patterns, languages, technologies and apply the to real time project. Please don't judge me by my public repositories, most of them are from my collage days and for fun, so nothing spectacular there. My best work is done for my clients.

- ⚽ My hobbies are: soccer, running, swimming, working out and chess ♟️!

- 👤 Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdo-vukojevic/). I love meeting new people and exchanging knowledge :)
